## Project Overview

This **Power BI Report** provides an end-to-end analysis of **Global Mining** and Mineral Production (2000-2021) to help industry stakeholders, investors, and policymakers identify market trends, optimize operations, and make data-driven decisions. The dashboard visualizes production patterns across **1000+ facilities**, **50+ countries**, and multiple commodity types, delivering comprehensive insights into coal and mineral production dynamics, processing efficiency, and corporate ownership structures.

---

## Business Objectives

- Analyze global coal and mineral production trends over 21 years (2000-2021).
- Identify top-performing countries and facilities by production volume and efficiency.
- Evaluate processing efficiency and value chain optimization opportunities.
- Track commodity-specific patterns for Gold, Copper, Nickel, Iron, Aluminum, and Coal.
- Support investment decision-making through facility-level performance metrics.
- Enable competitive benchmarking and market intelligence for mining companies.
- Assess ownership structures and corporate market positions.
- Monitor waste management and environmental impact metrics.

## Key Insights

### Global Coal Production (2000-2021)
![Male](Heart%20Disease%20Male%20Insights.PNG)
- Market Leaders: USA (19bn tonnes), China (16bn tonnes), India (15bn tonnes), Australia (10bn tonnes).
- Production Peak: Reached 8bn tonnes in 2015, followed by 50% decline post-2020.
- Processing Balance: Perfect 50-50 split between raw coal and clean coal (27M tonnes each).
- Energy Transition Impact: Sharp decline indicates global shift toward renewable energy sources.
- Sales Efficiency: Gap between production and sales narrowed significantly from 2000-2015.
- Material Diversity: F.coal dominates, with F.stc (sub-bituminous), F.lig (lignite), and F.abc as secondary types.

### Global Mineral Production (2000-2021)
![Female](Heart%20Disease%20Female%20Insights.PNG)
- Geographic Dominance: Australia (24bn tonnes), Brazil (16bn tonnes), Chile (12bn tonnes), USA (10bn tonnes).
- Processing Gap: Only 43% of mined ore is processed, with just 13% reaching concentrate stage.
- Value Chain Opportunity: Significant raw material export suggests processing expansion potential.
- Production Types: Ore Mined (45.4%), Ore Processed (43.4%), Concentrate (12.93%), NM Mineral (trace).
- Commodity Diversity: Bulk ores dominate, followed by copper (O.Cu), aluminum (O.Al), and gold (O.Au).
- Market Dynamics: Sales-production gap widening post-2015 indicates inventory buildup or oversupply.
- Growth-Decline Pattern: Consistent growth from 2bn (2000) to 8bn (2015), then sharp 50% decline by 2021.
